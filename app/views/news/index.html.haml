%h2 Saturday, October 14 - Meet the Candidate

  Jamie McLeod, Clare Callejon, Vanessa Cooper and Alison Coy hosted a

  gained support from various neighborhoods in Santa Clara.

%p
  We had numerous people sign up for lawn signs, window signs, dear friend
  postcards and for our walk next weekend.

%p Thank you for all your support.  With your help, we will win on November 7!

%h2 Saturday, September 16 - Santa Clara Art and Wine Festival

%p
  Dustin, Jennalynn and I all attended the Art and Wine Festival this weekend.
  Dustin and I worked in the Santa Clara Schools Foundation Wine Booth pouring
  wine for people. There were people from the district office and the
  Foundation there visiting and pouring.

%p
  Jennalynn performed with her dance group at the meadow stage just like she
  has done every year for the past five years. Her dance studio which is also
  in Santa Clara has been a part of the Art and Wine Festival for many years.

%p
  During the festival there were volunteers passing out my flyers. A big thank
  you to Karen Bergkamp and Family, Wendy Hoag and Family, Moncia Dupree and
  Family and Haley Alves and Family for taking the time out to pass out my
  flyers during the day. Hopefully we got the word out!


%h2 Friday, September 15 - A Night to Grill Noelani

%p
  We set this mock forum up to find out what the parents of Santa Clara were
  concerned about and what they wanted to know about.

%p
  The grilling turned out very well. We had some parents come out and ask
  great questions and make comments that I would like to take back and work
  on. One of my top concerns is that all students are getting the education
  they deserve and that teachers and parents have the tools to make them
  successful. I think we are doing a fantastic job but like in all areas of
  life we can do better. This is what I want to work on while in office.
  Making sure all parents get involved in their students education and that we
  provide them with the best education possible.
