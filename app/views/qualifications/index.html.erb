<h3>Next Visa for Learning Advisory Board, March, 2007 to Present</h3>

<p>As a member of the Next Vista advisory board I am an advocate for their case.  I discuss
their vision with potential users and contributors while being a support system both
technologically and financially (through fundraising).  We are currently rebuilding the entire
technological infrastructure providing a stable environment for current users and keeping
growth in mind.  The team that is currently rebuilding the site consists of members that I
acquired to help with this venture.</p>

<h3>Santa Clara Unified School District Board of Trustees Candidate, August 2006-November, 2006</h3>

	<p>After being urged by several people to run for the school board I decided that I could
	make more of a difference as a school board member than as a volunteer.  My campaign
	was run completely grassroots.  We used techniques for reaching voters both traditional and
	non-traditional.  Our non-traditional techniques included using programs that we developed to
	pull up the voter information based of location and party registration.  We developed precinct
	walking software and voter calling software. Our voter calling software was completely web
	based with the ability for multiple users to call voters. The web page displayed whether the
	voter was democrat or republican and changed the script accordingly.  We then had the ability
	to record the callers reaction and had data on all calls made. With this software I alone
	reached 500 voters in the last three days of my campaign.</p>

	<p>My campaign was unique because I had people from every socioeconomic class, race
	and age supporting me.  People came up to me after the election saying, “This is the first time
	I have voted when it was not a presidential election.”  Although I did not win I did
	accomplished and that was getting the vote out.</p>

<h3>Santa Clara Schools Foundation, Board of Directors,  2005 to Present</h3>

	<p>In 2005, the Santa Clara School District was going through some of the worst budget
	cuts since the DotCom bust.  I was approached by Rod Adams to join the Santa Clara
	Schools Foundation.  As a new member, I helped them focus on taking them to the next steps
	of fundraising and helped them created a new vision. </p>
	<p>During my three years with them I have gained the trust of the established board and was
	asked to be a part of the four person team who developed a new roadmap for the future, re-
	organized the group and produced new bylaws.</p>
	<p>Along with the Music Rivals a large project I produced (a district wide musical talent
	competition), helped initiate the Annual Campaign for the Santa Clara Schools Foundation
	(Which raised 50K), assisted in secure donations for the Marilyn Rea Golf Tournament.</p>
	<p>In addition to my fundraising work with the foundation, I created, designed and developed
		their brand new website. </p>

<h3>Santa Clara Unified School District, Wellness Committee 2005 to Present</h3>
	 <p>I assisted in creating new policies and acted as an advocate for
   students ability to receive healthy choices. I was in constant contact with
   press and was interviewed on the new policies and bold step that we so
   aggressively pushed through the school board.</p>

<h3>Bracher Elementary School Parent Teacher Association, President June 2004-June 2006</h3>

	<p>My time at Bracher was spent focusing on rebuilding communication between parents,
	teachers and administration. My ability to connect to various people, Our volunteer base went
	from 20 parents to just over 75 parents. We also increased our profits by 25%.</p>
	<p>With the money raised we were able to improve many projects.  The one most visible to
	the children was our free fun day and turn it into a  huge carnival where each child received a
	backpack, toys, games and food all for free.  We also were able to include a mostly free
	Santa’s workshop and a Mother’s and Father’s day workshop where children were able to
	come in and make art projects for those people they cared for. Finally, we
were able to increase the amount of money we gave to teachers yearly from $150
to $200.</p>
	<p>My focus during those two years was to create an organization that would
be self sustaining. I did this by creating new Bracher PTA policies. We
focused on healthy eating, open communication, community building and getting
parents involved. My husband and I produced the <a
href="http://www.bracherpta.org">Bracher PTA Website</a> )</p>

<h3>Santa Clara University Psychology Club Founder and President, 2002-2004</h3>

	<p>During my time at Santa Clara University there was a lack of support for
those interested in Psychology. On my own, I created the psychology club which
included writing the bylaws, finding club officers and creating the clubs
vision.</p>
	<p>While president, we visited Apple and NASA giving psychology majors the opportunity
	to see there are more careers out there for them.  We started a Senior-Freshmen mentoring
