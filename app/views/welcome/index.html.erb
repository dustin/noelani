<p> 
  Education is a major value in my life.  Whether it is going to school to get my master's degree in Clinical Psychology, reading about latest technology, or researching something that is of interest to me, I am committed to being a life-long learner. 
</p>

<p>
My background includes looking out for the best interests of all
children, not just my own.  My hard work on the <a
href="http://www.santaclaraschoolsfoundation.org/">Santa Clara Schools
Foundation</a> and the <a href="http://www.bracherpta.org">Bracher PTA</a> indicates my desire to 
ensure that every child has opportunities to learn, grow, and be
successful.  I want to help give all students the tools to be successful.
</p>

<p>
I would like to build on the current School Boardâ€™s commitment to high standards.  At this time, these can be achieved through the acquisition of fundamentals of literacy, math and science. However,  the bar can be raised even higher through creative the use of technology and more attention to the arts.  We are doing our children a huge disservice by not using every possible avenue to help them grow into a well rounded lifelong learners.

</p>

<p>
 We, as a district, can achieve this higher standard. In order to do so, we must not only support our current staff, but continue to recruit quality teachers.  We must do everything we can to encourage our parents and community members to become involved in the local schools.
</p>

<p>
	As a new board member, I will dedicate myself to build on the success and wisdom of the current board. I am ready and willing to work long and hard on the Santa Clara Unified School Board to maintain high achievement in our district and to continue to strive for the very best of our students. I hope to help the district, as a whole, focus more on making children and parents aware of all the resources available to them, and empowering children to achieve at an even higher level.
