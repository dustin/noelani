  Education has always been the cornerstone of my life. I am a proud product of
  the south bay public education system and daughter is currently enrolled in
  Santa Clara Public School system. My strong roots in local education have
  enabled me to become successful in my personal and professional life. In order
  to maintain a local standard of excellence, I am running for Santa Clara
  Unified School Board.

%p
  In order to help the district reach its full potential, I have worked many
  social outreach programs in the area including Santa Clara Schools foundation,
  Music Rivals, Nutrition Committee, and Bracher PTA association. My work has
  enabled countless children to improve their quality of live while enabling
  them to succeed in the classroom.

%p
  While I have great respect for the work of the Santa Clara Unified School
  board, I believe there are several unaddressed areas for improvement. First of
  all, I firmly believe the board needs to better utilize the plethora of
  technical knowledge found in Silicon Valley. In addition, I am a strong
  advocate for a drastic enhancement to the education fundamentals, including
  the arts, that enable our students for success.

%p
  In order to accomplish the district's goals, I will work tirelessly with our
  district and drive involvement from our community. My involvement in
  grass-roots organization coupled with my work in education provide me the
  background knowledge to implement change.

%p
  The district has always had a high standard of academic excellence. With my
  vision on the board, I believe we can continue to raise the bar academically
  and provide our children with an even brighter future.

%p
  My experience and close ties to the foundation of this district make me an
  ideal candidate for the Santa Clara Unified School Board. My relentless
  passion for creating a better school system for fourteen-thousand students,
  including my daughter, will become a strong asset for this district.
